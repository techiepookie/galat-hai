## 🛡 **How It Works**

This extension uses Chrome's official **Manifest V3 DNR API**:

* No background tasks
* No CPU usage
* No privacy issues
* Extremely fast URL filtering

When a URL matches any keyword in `rules.json`, Chrome instantly redirects the user to your custom HTML page.

---

## 🎯 **Editing Blocked Keywords**

Open `rules.json` and modify:

```json
"urlFilter": "porn"
```

Add new rules by copying blocks. Reload extension after changes.

---

## 🎨 **Custom Icon Setup**

Use your own `icon.png` and update manifest:

```json
"icons": {
  "16": "icon.png",
  "32": "icon.png",
  "48": "icon.png",
  "128": "icon.png"
}
```

Icon recommended sizes: `128×128`.
